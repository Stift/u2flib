## U2F 

Provides functionality for working with the server side aspects of the U2F protocol on Windows. 

The solution is nearly a line for line copy of the JAVA implementation rewritten in C# using the .NET 4.0 framework. 
I ported the JAVA example to .NET to help spread the adoption of U2F.

Original source JAVA library is located below:
